A data engineering pipeline for generative AI fine-tuning is a structured workflow that collects, cleans, organizes, and prepares raw data so it can be used to train or adapt large language models (LLMs). The pipeline ensures that the training dataset is high-quality, safe, diverse, and aligned with the target use case (such as chatbots, coding assistants, or domain-specific Q&A).

The pipeline typically involves these stages:

Ingestion – Gather raw data from multiple sources (documents, support tickets, APIs, logs, code, etc.).

Normalization – Convert data into a unified format (commonly JSONL with instruction–response pairs or chat turns).

Cleaning & Governance – Remove duplicates, redact personal/sensitive information, filter out toxic or irrelevant content, and enforce licensing rules.

Quality Checks – Validate schema, check token lengths, and apply policy filters to keep only reliable examples.

Splitting – Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets while preventing data leakage.

Tokenization & Packing – Convert text into model tokens and efficiently batch sequences for training.

Augmentation (optional) – Enhance data through paraphrasing, Q/A generation, or synthetic samples.

Catalog & Lineage Tracking – Version datasets, log metadata, and ensure reproducibility.

Orchestration – Automate the entire process using workflow managers (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster).

Handoff to Training – Deliver curated, tokenized datasets to fine-tuning frameworks (LoRA, QLoRA, full fine-tuning).

By enforcing data quality, safety, and reproducibility, this pipeline ensures the fine-tuned model is accurate, aligned with business goals, and free of harmful or leaking content.
